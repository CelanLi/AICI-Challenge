# React Challenge of AICI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key implementation details

**1. TypeScript Integration:**
TypeScript is utilized to enforce strong typing throughout the project, ensuring robust type safety and catching potential errors during development.

**2. Axios for HTTP Requests:**
Axios is employed as the HTTP client to handle asynchronous requests. Its flexibility and promise-based API simplify data fetching and management of API interactions.

**3. State Management with Hooks:**
The project utilizes Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks to manage component state and side effects. This approach facilitates efficient state updates and re-renders, enhancing the responsiveness and performance of the application.

## Attention

Before you run ### `npm start`, you may first run ### `npm install` since I have used Axios for http request.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
